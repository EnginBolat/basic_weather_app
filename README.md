# Before Proceeding With The Installation

First of all i wanna thank the DEVSPOT youtube channel for the sharing this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToPdSd42UKA) with us.

For the "YOUR API KEY" part in the main.dart file, you must register on the [site](https://openweathermap.org) and take the api key and paste it in the place I specified.

If you want, you can use the [apk](https://github.com/EnginBolat/basic_weather_app/blob/main/app-release.apk) file. There is a ready-made api in it.
